## Description
This project is a simple color detector using TCS3200 as the sensor, Adruino UNO R3 as the Microcontroller, and Servo Motor SG90 as the Actuator. 
The process that happen in this project is when the sensor detected a certain color, it will turn the servo motor to a certain degree as it is already set in the code.
Additionally this project use the PID theory for the speed and accuracy of the servo motor.
